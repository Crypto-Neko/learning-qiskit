List of 10 quantum circuit ideas with increasing complexity for learning Qiskit:

1. **Single-Qubit Gates (Basic):**  
   Construct a quantum circuit that applies basic gates like Pauli-X, Pauli-Y, and Pauli-Z to a single qubit. Use the `X`, `Y`, and `Z` gates to see how they affect the state of a qubit.

2. **Hadamard Gate (Basic):**  
   Apply the Hadamard (`H`) gate to a qubit to create a superposition state. Measure the qubit to observe the probabilistic outcome.

3. **Bell State Circuit (Intermediate):**  
   Create a Bell state using two qubits by applying a Hadamard gate to the first qubit and a CNOT gate between the two qubits. This circuit introduces quantum entanglement.

4. **Quantum Teleportation (Intermediate):**  
   Implement the quantum teleportation protocol, where a qubit's state is transferred between two parties using entanglement and classical communication.

5. **Quantum Phase Estimation (Advanced):**  
   Simulate the quantum phase estimation algorithm, which is key in many quantum algorithms, such as Shor’s algorithm.

6. **Grover’s Search Algorithm (Advanced):**  
   Implement Grover’s search algorithm to search for a marked element in an unsorted list. This circuit uses multiple qubits and the Oracle function.

7. **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) (Advanced):**  
   Build a circuit that performs the Quantum Fourier Transform, which is used in many quantum algorithms, including Shor’s.

8. **Shor’s Algorithm (Complex):**  
   Implement Shor’s algorithm for integer factorization. This is a more complex algorithm that requires understanding QFT and modular arithmetic.

9. **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) (Complex):**  
   Use a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm like VQE to find the ground state energy of a small molecule. This involves parameterized quantum circuits and optimization.

10. **Quantum Error Correction (Complex):**  
   Design a simple error-correcting code like the 3-qubit repetition code to protect quantum information from errors. This involves multiple qubits and gate operations for encoding, error detection, and correction.
